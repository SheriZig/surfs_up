# Sufs Up Analysis 
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze whether data to determine if opening a Surf and Shake shop in Hawaii is feasible. During a vacation in Hawaii I had the idea of opening a Surf and Milkshake shop on the same island. I have some saving Iâ€™m willing to invest but in order to open the shop, I will need funds from an investor. I met with W. Avy but he is concerned about the whether conditions due to having a past surf shop that did not succeed due to the precipitation amounts on the island. 

W. Avy provided weather data from the prospective island for analysis. The data contained Measurement data to include both temperature and precipitation data. The file also contained information relating to the various weather reporting stations. The analysis focused on dates between 08/23/2016 and 08/23/2017. 

## Results
The analysis consisted of 2021 weather station data points from nine stations. Most days there is below an inch of rain with very few days that the precipitation exceeds three inches for any given day. 

- Mean precipitation for the year was .18 
- Max precipitation 6.7
