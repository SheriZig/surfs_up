# Sufs Up Analysis 
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze whether data to determine if opening a Surf and Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii is feasible. During a vacation in Oahu I had the idea of opening a Surf and Milkshake shop on the same island. I have some saving I’m willing to invest but in order to open the shop, I will need funds from an investor. I met with W. Avy but he is concerned about the whether conditions due to having a past surf shop that did not succeed due to the precipitation amounts on the island. 

W. Avy provided weather data from the prospective island for analysis. The data contained Measurement data to include both temperature and precipitation data. The file also contained information relating to the various weather reporting stations. The analysis focused on dates between 08/23/2016 and 08/23/2017. 

## Results
The analysis consisted of 2021 weather station data points from nine stations. Most days there is below an inch of rain with very few days that the precipitation exceeds three inches for any given day. 

- Mean precipitation for the year was .18 
- Max precipitation 6.7

Temperature data was also analyzed to determine if the weather is compatible with surfing and milkshakes. The months of June and December were evaluated. 

June Temperatures
- Mean 75 degrees
- Low 64 degrees
- High 85 degrees

## Summary 
Oahu will provide the ideal location. There is enough rain to keep everything green but not enough to keep the surfers away. Based on the analysis, the precipitation levels will meet the criteria for providing for greenery but also allow for visitors to visit the beaches for surfing and snacking. 
The moderate temperatures in the 70’s are desirable ranges for visitors to participate in outdoor activities. 
Additional queries could be written to determine stations that are closest to the location of the shop to narrow down the results for both temps and precipitation to analyze a smaller dataset that will provide relevance to the location.
